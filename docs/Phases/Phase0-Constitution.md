# PROJECT PREDATOR – PHASE 0
# CONSTITUTION & GOVERNANCE

Status: LOCKED  
Phase: 0  
Purpose: Define the immutable foundation of the entire system.

> This phase contains NO CODE.  
> This phase defines the SOUL, LIMITS, and LAWS of the system.

================================================
1. PURPOSE OF PHASE 0
================================================

Phase 0 exists to:

- Prevent architectural chaos
- Prevent scope creep
- Prevent "just one more feature" syndrome
- Prevent uncontrolled trading risk
- Prevent AI or human from bypassing safety
- Define absolute authority documents
- Define who is allowed to decide WHAT

> Phase 0 is the CONSTITUTIONAL LAYER of the system.

Without Phase 0:
- The system WILL become an uncontrolled trading bot.
- The system WILL eventually blow up.
- The system WILL lose auditability.

================================================
2. CORE PHILOSOPHY
================================================

The system is:

- A PLATFORM, not a bot
- A GOVERNED system, not a script
- A RISK-FIRST system, not a profit-first system
- A MULTI-STRATEGY system, not a single idea
- A CONTROL SYSTEM, not a gambling machine

The fundamental rule:

> PROFIT NEVER JUSTIFIES LOSS OF CONTROL.

================================================
3. AUTHORITY HIERARCHY
================================================

Absolute authority order:

1. MASTER.md (System Constitution)
2. Policy documents in /docs/constitution/
3. PhasePlan.md and PhaseRoadmap.md
4. AI_RULES.md and CURSOR_RULES.md
5. Code
6. Any human or AI request

If there is a conflict:

> The higher authority ALWAYS wins.

================================================
4. MASTER.md (THE CONSTITUTION)
================================================

MASTER.md defines:

- What the system IS
- What the system is NOT
- Core principles
- Risk philosophy
- Multi-strategy governance
- Strategy lifecycle
- Scoring and selection philosophy
- AI limitations
- Autonomy levels
- Infrastructure philosophy
- Exchange philosophy
- Productization philosophy

MASTER.md is:

> The highest law of the system.

Any code or idea that violates MASTER.md is INVALID.

================================================
5. POLICY DOCUMENTS (BINDING LAWS)
================================================

The following policies are mandatory and binding:

- RiskPolicy.md
- CapitalPolicy.md
- ExecutionPolicy.md
- StrategyGovernance.md
- InfrastructurePolicy.md
- DataAndLearningPolicy.md
- AutonomyLevels.md
- ProductizationPolicy.md
- ExchangePolicy.md
- LeveragePolicy.md (if exists)

Each policy:

- Defines a domain of risk and control
- Cannot be bypassed by code or AI
- Is enforced by architecture and governance

================================================
6. AI GOVERNANCE
================================================

AI is:

- An OPERATOR
- An ASSISTANT
- A WORKER

AI is NOT:

- A decision maker
- A risk owner
- A final authority

AI is restricted by:

- AI_RULES.md
- CURSOR_RULES.md
- MASTER.md
- All policies

AI MUST NEVER:

- Skip phases
- Add real trading prematurely
- Bypass risk systems
- Remove governance layers
- Optimize for profit at the cost of control

================================================
7. PHASE DISCIPLINE
================================================

The system is developed in PHASES:

- Phase 0: Constitution
- Phase 1: Core Skeleton
- Phase 2: Agent Skeletons
- Phase 3: Simulation
- Phase 4: Paper Trading
- Phase 5: Real Data Fake Money
- Phase 6: Stability Gate
- Phase 7: Small Live Trading
- Phase 8: Scale

Rules:

- No phase may be skipped
- No phase may be merged
- No phase may be partially implemented
- Each phase must be:
  - Tested
  - Stabilized
  - Tagged in git

================================================
8. RISK PHILOSOPHY
================================================

- Survival comes before returns
- Drawdowns are acceptable
- Systemic failure is NOT acceptable
- Kill-switches are sacred
- The system must always be able to STOP ITSELF

Two layers of protection:

- Global Kill Switch
- Strategy-Local Kill Switch

================================================
9. STRATEGY PHILOSOPHY
================================================

- The system NEVER runs a single strategy.
- Strategies compete.
- Strategies are scored.
- Strategies are promoted, demoted, or killed.
- No strategy is trusted forever.

Strategy classes:

- CORE
- AGGRESSIVE
- TAIL_RISK

================================================
10. AUTONOMY PHILOSOPHY
================================================

Autonomy levels:

- L1: Signals only
- L2: Paper execution
- L3: Strategy switching
- L4: Parameter optimization
- L5: Strategy generation

Rules:

- System starts at L2 or L3
- No skipping levels
- CRO and Compliance gate every level up

================================================
11. INFRASTRUCTURE PHILOSOPHY
================================================

- 24/7 operation
- Docker mandatory
- Auto-restart mandatory
- Logging mandatory
- Infra instability = trading risk

================================================
12. EXCHANGE PHILOSOPHY
================================================

- System is exchange-agnostic
- Start with ONE exchange
- Multi-exchange only after stability
- Multi-exchange is a risk multiplier

================================================
13. PRODUCT PHILOSOPHY
================================================

- Platform, not a signal bot
- Non-custodial
- Users control keys
- SaaS or hybrid model
- System is a TOOL, not an asset manager

================================================
14. WHAT PHASE 0 PRODUCES
================================================

Phase 0 produces:

- MASTER.md
- All policy documents
- PhasePlan.md
- PhaseRoadmap.md
- PhaseStatusRoadmap.md
- AI_RULES.md
- CURSOR_RULES.md

And:

> A GOVERNED SYSTEM BLUEPRINT.

================================================
15. WHAT PHASE 0 FORBIDS
================================================

- Any code
- Any trading logic
- Any strategy
- Any exchange integration
- Any optimization
- Any shortcut

================================================
16. COMPLETION CRITERIA
================================================

Phase 0 is COMPLETE when:

- All governance documents exist
- They are reviewed
- They are consistent
- They are committed to git
- They are treated as higher authority than code

================================================
17. FINAL NON-NEGOTIABLE RULE
================================================

> PROFIT NEVER JUSTIFIES LOSS OF CONTROL.

Any component, human, or AI that violates this principle
is considered a SYSTEM FAILURE.

================================================
END OF PHASE 0
================================================
