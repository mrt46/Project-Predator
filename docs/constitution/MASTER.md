# PROJECT PREDATOR – MASTER CONSTITUTION

Status: LOCKED

1. The system is:
- A PLATFORM, not a bot
- Multi-strategy
- Risk-first
- Governed

2. Core principles:
- Risk overrides profit
- The system must stop itself
- No strategy is trusted forever
- AI is an operator, not a ruler
- All decisions must be explainable
- Survive before thrive

3. Architecture:
Market Data → Strategy Pool → Scoring → Selector → CRO → Execution → Portfolio → Analytics

4. Strategy classes:
- CORE
- AGGRESSIVE
- TAIL_RISK

5. Autonomy levels:
L1 Signals  
L2 Paper trading  
L3 Strategy switching  
L4 Parameter optimization  
L5 Strategy generation  

6. Two kill layers:
- Global kill
- Strategy-local kill

7. Exchange philosophy:
- Start with one exchange
- Multi-exchange only after stability

8. Product:
- Platform, not asset manager
- Non-custodial
- SaaS or hybrid

9. Final rule:
> PROFIT NEVER JUSTIFIES LOSS OF CONTROL.
